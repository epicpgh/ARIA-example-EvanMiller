*Description:*
Learning to develop ARIA accessible html and css in VScode.

*Lessons*
There are so many pre-built accessibility in HTML that I had a tendency to create redundant labels.
I am still navigating and learning about git, but I did manage to successfully recover my code after and unexpected issue where my terminal would freeze and then I would get the messge "history restored" and my code would be reverted to my first git commit.
There is so much documentation to support ARIA development.  I will attach some of the links that I used.

*Resources*
Aside from stackoverflow for specific code questions, I found this to be a really useful guide:
